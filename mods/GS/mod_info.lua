description = [[Adds two groups scatter actions that allow you to loop over units in selected group.

Quick mode switches to next unit after order being given to previous one with save of current command mode (e.g. attack, launch, move)
Continuous mode only switches to next unit if bind is pressed. Supports template order.

Makes sound when cycle is complete. You can press to select previous selection again.
