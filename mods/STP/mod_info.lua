    Allows you to target specific category of a unit.
    Hover over needed one and press keybind.
    There are two different features: 
        first one target_specific_type allows you to target only this kind on a unit;
        second one target_specific_common set target priority as common categoty for this unit:
        mass fabricator -> all mass fabricators from t3 to t3
        flak -> all static aa and then maa
        engineer -> engineers from t3 to t1
        ... and so on.
    Keybind target_specific works in both ways: one click targets common category, double click - unit's kind.
    You can always change some for your own in `/mods/STP/modules/PriorityMapper.lua`.
    GL HF!
