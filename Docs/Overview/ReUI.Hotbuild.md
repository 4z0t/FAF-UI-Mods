# ReUI.Hotbuild

Previously "HotBuild Overhaul". Currently it is slightly improved HotBuild Overhaul mod. But in addition it allows you to use templates in building sets.

Template items are highlighted with yellow color. **Fill** button will convert template for all factions.

ReUI.Hotbuild changes default mechanism of hotbuild and fixes previously addressed [issue](#69) with it. Since now on factory sets are picking only ***one*** item, you can't have multiple items for a factory as it was before.
