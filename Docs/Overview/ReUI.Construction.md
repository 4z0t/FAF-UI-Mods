# ReUI.Construction

ReUI.Construction is complete overhaul of original construction panel. Optimized, extendable and improved with new features over original one.
Currently it is missing some of the features of original panel, such as templates, but it will be added in future.

Improvements over original construction panel:

* can be scaled
* order of units in selection is deterministic and is sorted in this order: engineers -> Land units -> Air units -> Naval units -> Structures and everything else
* queue drag is more stable and also works for mobile factories
